              <p>My dearest,</p>
              <p>
                As we celebrate our first year together, I wanted to take a moment to put into words what you mean to me.
                Before you, I never knew love could be this simple yet profound.
              </p>
              <p>
                You've shown me what it means to be truly seen and accepted. Your kindness, your humor, your heart â€“ they've
                all become essential parts of my world. I love the way you listen, really listen, when I talk about my day.
                I love how you remember the smallest details about things that matter to me.
              </p>
              <p>
                This past year has been the most beautiful adventure. We've laughed until our sides hurt, held each other
                through difficult moments, and created countless memories I'll cherish forever.
              </p>
              <p>
                I don't know what the future holds, but I know I want to face it with you. Thank you for being my partner, my
                best friend, and the love that makes everything brighter.
              </p>
              <p>Here's to our first year â€“ and to many, many more.</p>
              <p>All my love,</p>
              <p>Me ðŸ’–</p>
